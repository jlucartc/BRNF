# gem_nf

## Features
- Issues brazilian invoice(in progress)
- generates test invoice with random data(Ready! See an example of valid invoice xml at [this file](https://github.com/jlucartc/gem_nf/blob/master/nota_exemplo.xml))

## Future improvements
- Random invoice data still doesn't have any configuration options, like selecting certain groups or filling in part of the xml with your own data. This will be included in the future.
